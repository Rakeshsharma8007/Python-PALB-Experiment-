# 6.Write a program that takes two random integers as input and lists them from smallest to largest.
# (Condition: Two integers are not the same number.)
# Coding guideline: Receive the user's input with the input function and convert it to an integer using the int function. 
# Next, use an if statement to compare and print the two values.

# 8.Among the positive natural numbers other than 1, a number that is not prime is called a composite number. Print the

# 12.With tuple data, the values of two variables can be swapped without using a temporary variable. Using this swapping 
# method, write a program that moves the largest value in the given list to the last.
